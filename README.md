## Discord-list-bot
A small Discord bot to write list and see other users lists. List could be favourite movies,bands, characters or whatever. 

The Bot can either be used with the Prefix "!" or with the Discord "/" commands.

Furthermore the bot can support a quot system.

The Bot now scrapes https://special.goodsmile.info/popupparade/en/ for new releases and sends them via a specific channel.

There are also some random commands like seeing the current Apex Legends map or getting an image from an API tag.
